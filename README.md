# üíå Telegram Love Bot

A Python bot that sends a daily AI-generated love message (using OpenAI GPT-4o) to your partner via Telegram.

This project was born from the desire to maintain an emotional connection even at a distance. Every day, the bot generates a new, unique message‚Äîtender, playful, or cheeky‚Äîbut always full of intention.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telegram-love-bot.git
   cd telegram-love-bot

2. Install dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Create your .env file
TELEGRAM_API_ID=your_telegram_api_id
TELEGRAM_API_HASH=your_telegram_api_hash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
TELEGRAM_TARGET=@username_or_contact_name

4. Create the prompt.txt file (you can start from prompt.txt.example) and customize it according to your relationship:

    cp prompt.txt.example prompt.txt
    ```

5. Run the bot manually

# Automation
## Locally (cronjob)
You can use cron to run the script every day at 10:00, even if the computer was off (see check_and_run.sh if included).

## On Google Cloud
Deploy the function as a Cloud Function with a Pub/Sub trigger.

Use Cloud Scheduler to invoke the function daily.

No need for servers; it runs only when scheduled.

# Security
The customized prompt is not uploaded by default (see .gitignore).

The history is only saved in a local file.

No bot tokens are used: the bot acts as an authenticated user (Telethon).

# What is this for?
This bot is a daily reminder of love, complicity, and connection.
Ideal for long-distance couples, relationships with a rich history, or simply for those who don't want to let a single day pass without saying "I love you."
